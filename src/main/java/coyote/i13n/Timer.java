/**
 * Timers are devices for measuring the time something takes and the Timer 
 * interface models a contract for all timers.
 * 
 * <p>Timers measure the time between phases of execution. Once a Timer is 
 * started, its stores the time and waits for a call to stop(). Once stopped, 
 * it calculates the total elapsed time for that run.
 * 
 * <p>Later a Timer (actually the entire set) can be rolled-up to provide the 
 * number of invocations, mean, long and short elapsed intervals and several 
 * other phase-oriented metrics in a manner similar to those of counters and 
 * states.
 * 
 * <p>The fixture tracks a Timer by its name where each name represents a 
 * Master Timer that is used to accrue all the data of Timers with the same 
 * name.
 * 
 * <p>There are two types of Timers, a Timed Timer and a Null Timer. During 
 * normal operation the fixture issues a Timed Timer that tracks the time 
 * between its start and stop methods are called finally placing the results in 
 * its master Timer. If monitoring has been disabled for either the entire 
 * fixture or for a specific named Timer, then a Null Timer is issued. It 
 * implements the exact same interface as the timed Timer, but the Null Timer 
 * contains no logic thereby saving on processing when monitoring is not 
 * desired.
 * 
 * <p>A single Timer reference can be started and stopped several times, each 
 * interval between the start-stop calls being added to the accrued value of 
 * the Timer.
