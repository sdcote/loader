/**
 * The Role class models a named collection of permissions.
 * 
 * <p>Permissions are assigned to roles and permission checks are performed 
 * against roles as opposed to individuals to keep the number of permission 
 * collections to a minimum. This makes permission management easier.
 * 
 * <p>In some simplified security schemes, components only check for the role 
 * to grant access to resources. For example, if the 'admin' role is presented, 
 * the component may allow access to all its resources. Just the use of 
 * resources can implement a RBAC security model.
 * 
 * <p>In more complex security models, roles are not as important as are the 
 * permissions assigned to them. In these cases, components aggregate all the 
 * permissions from all the roles presented to determine access to its 
 * resources. This approach then uses roles as collections of permissions and 
 * use roles as a way to better manage large collections of permissions.
